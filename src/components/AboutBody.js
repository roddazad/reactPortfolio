        Hello Everyone, My name is Rodd Azad. I am a lucky Dad to a wonderful 7 year old son who is the biggest motivation of my life.
        I am 36 years old and have had no technical background up untill recently where I've been participating in the fullstack web Development
        program. I can't tell you how much I regret not getting into this field sooner in my life.
        It's fun and challenging at the same time. I can't wait to be part of a great team sometime in the near future to be gaining more knowledge and experties.
         </p>
